# My-Machine-Learning-Track-DataCamp

This repository contains jupyter notebooks summarizing my notes of some courses in the[Machine Learning Engineer Track in DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tracks/machine-learning-scientist-with-python). Probably the courses to be added are those directly realted to machine learning instead of deep learning and NLP, which can be added later in a different repositories.

I personally believe that DataCamp courses, thus this repository, should be considered to be a resource that only focuses on the coding part rather than the therortically and conceptually part. For most of courses, you may want to check some other courses to take a look on the mathematical basis of such algorithms and models. When done, you may find this repository a good resource during coding.
